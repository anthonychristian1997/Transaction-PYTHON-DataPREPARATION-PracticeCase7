# Transaction-PYTHON-DataPREPARATION-PracticeCase7
In this repository, I implement a data preparation process. Data preparation is the stage where we prepare data for machine learning processes or other things related to data analysis.

Data preparation is one of the most important steps in doing machine learning or just doing a simple analysis. By preparing the data properly, we will also produce quality results.

In this repository, I have tried to use a more advanced and complete data preparation method. In carrying out the data preparation process, each data is unique and its own handler.
